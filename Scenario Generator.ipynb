    "1. Depending on the location of the murder, the body is randomly moved to a certain location (cliffs, beach, harbor, etc.). and a trail of physical evidence is left (a weapon, belongings, bloody footprint/handprint, etc.) along with the body.\n",
    "2. Part of the gameplay involves finding the body, determining cause and location of death, and piecing together timeline of the murder to rule out certain characters. Furthermore, the gameplay involves narrowing down the list of suspects using information about their motives.\n",
    "3. Game generates a network of motives (based on archetypes) and randomly imposes them on the cast of characters; these motives can either be procedurally generated eventually, but initially we will fix the relative network of motives and randomly impose them on the characters. The detective must discover the network of motives to narrow down the list of suspects.\n",
    "4. Characters may randomly reveal their knowledge of their own and other characters' motives to the detective. Physical evidence of motives may also exist in the suspects or victim's belongings. The motive network is what may create red herrings.\n",
    "5. The detective must work discreetly to avoid alerting the suspects and the murderer. If he asks questions that are too forthright to the suspects involved in the case, the murderer may become hostile and retaliate. The game will alert the detective that the murderer is wary of him, and may even send the detective a hostile warning message. The detective effectively has a \"budget\" of interview questions and investigations which he may conduct, hence he must use his intuition to look for clues in the right places. If he uses his budget up or too much is revealed without the detective confronting the murderer, the murderer may confront the detective and kill him. The challenge of the game is to use intuition and deduction to efficiently look for clues and solve the murder."
